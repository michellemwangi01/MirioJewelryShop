# MIRIO JEWELLERS

## Description

This project is a jewelry sales site that facilitates a platform for different vendors to register and showcase their jewelry collections through pictures. Customers can browse the collections, make purchases, and complete payments securely.

The code in this project utilizes fetch requests to retrieve jewelry data from the server. It dynamically creates jewelry cards to display the collections of various vendors. Users can add their favorite jewelry items to a favorites list and remove them as needed.

Additionally, the project includes robust form submission and validation functionalities. Vendors can register by submitting their information, including details about their jewelry products. The form ensures that the required fields are filled and validates the input data before sending it to the server for registration.

`Jewelry Vendor List:` View list of all vendors in a sliding carousel.
`Collection Gallery: ` View the collection of all items for sale.
`Filter gallery items per vendor:` Gallery can be filtered per vendor by clicking on each vendor image card.
